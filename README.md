# Rss_Digest

This is a python script that is designed to take a json of rss feed locations and a bloom filter. 
You run it, and it gives you a since-last-time's worth of new feed activity. 

You'll need to add another file `authinfo.json`. It has three fields. `email_pass`, `email_from`, and `email_to`. These do what you'd expect.
